### Hackathon rules (01.02.2017)

* All card colors and play modes are counted equally (e.g. Obeabe is not multiplied by 3)
* A session finishes when 2500 points are reached after a game ended
* Bots play together and must no communicate with each other
* Each team plays against every other team once (Round-robin tournament), the team with the most session victories, wins the hackathon and will be remembered forever
* Bots may use 0.5s max per turn. Otherwise they will be disconnected and lose the current session
