### Hackathon rules (01.02.2017)

* All card colors and play modes are counted equally (e.g. Obeabe is not multiplied by 3)
* A session finishes when 2500 points are reached
* Bots play together and must no communicate
* All teams play each other team, the team with the most session wins, wins the hackathon and will be remembered forever
* Bots may use 0.5s max per turn, otherwise they will be disconnected for the current game session
